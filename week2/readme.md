TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#Exercise 0:

I haven't touched python in too long all these arguments and function commands are hard to remember let alone look for. The nuance differences between the vast python commands makes life hard :'(.

converting to int to str:
str(int)

converting upper:
string.upper()
or
string.ascii_upper()


#Exercise 1:
I got the answers mostly...
An array was the wrong term. I looked it up these are lists. Almost the same but array is not as versatile for manipulation

List use []
Array is Array([])


#Exercise 2:
the whole thing was difficult to understand :( but I got it in the end. Just assigned a letter of the alphabet with a zero indexed number using indices and map function.

#Exercise 3:
Work isn't too hard just need to read over python documentation and trial and error using python on the terminal.

Gotta remember to initialise lists before calling them with an empty list.

eg. list1 = []

while is for condition loop
for is a set number of loop use range()

##Flowchart remade:

##Loop 5 was very annoying: 
Answer was looking for a string as with brackets in it and coordinates inside. I interpreted as a tuple inside a string.... I left the tuple as a comment out of spite.
