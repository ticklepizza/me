TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I've has a small coding background especially in python, this makes the first several weeks of this code quite easy. I just need to remember function names as I frequently confuse C and python. The environment is of great help as there is auto complete and drop downs for function names.

I initially guessed printing was done with printf, but as the environment showed me that was most likely a C thing.
