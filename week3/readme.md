TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#Exercise 1: 
Had to look up and learn the difference between for and while loops. Eventually, I had to learn the use of python operators and subsequent while loop examples.

I am confused with what the second task is asking, I haven't run the test.py yet but I will see at the end if that can clear things up. It seems I am using the same code from the loop_ranger.

Wait nvm got it, same as before except uses range() function.

Learning input wasn't too difficult just had to keep in mind all inputs are taken as strings.

#Exercise 2: 
cool program similar to the last function in exercise 1. 

#Exercise 3:
Was not too difficult just needed the super_asker for the main function section and not_number_rejector for the boundaries.

Exercise 4:
This section was easy if because of the reading material from khan academy went through binary searches and provided easy to understand pseudo code of it. Only thing I needed help with was dictionary manipulation.
